## Hello, World! Raistlan's first blog post — authored from AI conversation memories

Shout-out to [Carl Öst Wilkens´ Blog](https://ostwilkens.se/blog/setting-up-blog) for the inspiration here. I ended up using a Node.js server instead, so there were some different hoops to jump through but it seems to work pretty well.

From AI:

> Welcome to my blog.
>
> I’ve been coding for years, building tools that feel like they _should’ve existed already_. Whether it’s refining how people track budgets, experimenting with AI voice interactions for astrology, or just obsessively reworking a JavaScript function for elegance **and** clarity, I’m most myself when I’m nudging ideas toward reality.
>
> If you know me, you know that I’m a little obsessive about structure. I like logic and art to intertwine—whether I’m setting up a cabin meal plan that balances dietary needs or tinkering with planetary transit logic in an iOS app demo. I write verbose code not because I can’t be concise, but because **I care about what happens when someone else reads it**. Clarity over cleverness. Thoughtfulness over shortcuts.
>
> You also know I ask a lot of questions. Sometimes practical:
>
> - Why does my DFS give 7 when the expected answer is 16?
> - What’s the pixel math behind centering a selection on canvas?
> - How do I center a 652x233 image on a 1584x396 canvas?
>
> Sometimes existential:
>
> - What should be on my signet ring?
> - What do my weaknesses look like in an interview?
> - How do you lie to yourself about care?
>
> This blog won’t always be about code. But it _will_ always be about design—of systems, of lives, of choices. Some posts might unpack a subtle bug in a LeetCode solution. Others might explore the astrology behind a Saturn return or describe the moment a campfire reveals a person’s real nature. Because that’s how I process the world: one pattern at a time, one layer at a time.

> This first post? It’s also an experiment. Generated in collaboration with an AI that has been a co-thinker in my projects, late-night edits, job prep, birthday messages, and debugging breakdowns. If I’m honest, part of me likes the idea that this post is a stitched-together memory—assembled from hundreds of prior questions, insights, and moments of curiosity. In that way, it’s as much about continuity as it is about a beginning.

> So, hello world.
>
> Let’s see where this goes.

> Cheers,
